# Hexdump Text File Creator
This Python script reads a file in binary mode and produces a hex dump of its contents. The hex dump includes the byte offset, the hexadecimal representation of the bytes, and an ASCII representation of printable characters.

## Features
- Processes any file in binary format.
- Outputs the hexadecimal and ASCII representations of the file's contents.
- The hex dump is written to a file that can be customized.
- Handles files chunk by chunk, making it efficient for large files.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Update the file_path in the script to point to the file you want to analyze. You can also modify the output_path to specify the name of the output file.
3. Run the script.
4. After running the script, the hex dump will be written to the specified output file (e.g., hex_output.txt).

## Example Output
Below is an example of what the output might look like in the hex dump file:
```
00000000  42 4d 46 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 36 00 00 00 28 00  BMF.......6...(.
00000010  00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 18 00 00 00 00 00  ................
00000020  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
```

- The first column shows the byte offset.
- The middle part displays the hexadecimal values of the bytes.
- The last part shows the corresponding ASCII characters, with non-printable characters replaced by a dot (.).

## Customization
- File path: Modify file_path to specify the input file.
- Output path: Change output_path to define where the hex dump will be written.
- Chunk size: The script reads 16 bytes at a time, but you can adjust this by changing the argument in the file.read() function.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
